# Diffusion Phenomenon with Brownian Motion

Showcases a simulation of a diffusion phenomenon using Brownian motion. The 3D simulation is implemented with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
Each particle in the simulation experiences random movement in three dimensions, known as Brownian motion, leading to a diffusion phenomenon.
